            Introduction
        </header>
        <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed
            in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
            languages such as JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
            multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues
            for the appearance of the document.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Markup">
        <header>Markup</header>
        <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes),
            character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in
            pairs like <code><h1> </h1></code>,although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example
            <img>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called
            opening tags and closing tags).

        </p>
        <p>Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.

        </p>
        <p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</p>
        <code><!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>This is a title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div>
          <p>Hello world!</p>
      </div>
    </body>
  </html></code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Elements">
        <header>Elements</header>
        <p>HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags,
            enclosed in angle brackets thus:
        <p>.
        <p>In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag"
        <p> and "end tag" </p>. The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.
        </p>
        <p>
            The start tag may also include element's attributes within the tag. These indicate other information, such
            as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the
            presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the <img> used to embed images, the reference to the
            image resource in the format like this: <code><img src="example.com/example.jpg">
  </code>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
        <header>Data types</header>
        <p>HTML defines several data types for element content, such as script data and stylesheet data, and a plethora
            of types for attribute values, including IDs, names, URIs, numbers, units of length, languages, media
            descriptors, colors, character encodings, dates and times, and so on. All of these data types are
            specializations of character data.</p>


        <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
            system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript
            has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based
            model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript
            also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
            objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Element_examples">
        <header>Element examples</header>
        <p>
            Header of the HTML document: <code><head>...</head></code>. The title is included in the head, for example:
        </p>
        <p><code><head>
    <title>The Title</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylebyjimbowales.css" /> <!-- Imports Stylesheets -->
  </head></code></p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Headings">
        <header>Headings</header>
        <p>HTML headings are defined with the <code>
    <h1>-<h6>
     </code>tags with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>
                <ul>
                    <li><h1>Heading level 1</h1></li>
                    <li><h2>Heading level 2</h2></li>
                    <li><h3>Heading level 3</h3></li>
                    <li><h4>Heading level 4</h4></li>
                    <li><h5>Heading level 5</h5></li>
                    <li><h6>Heading level 6</h6></li>
                </ul>
